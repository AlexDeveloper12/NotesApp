# Notes Application

I have built many projects using React-Native but I wanted to build one that involved gaining experience with testing (using Jest) , in addition to following a consistent design.

The note application uses Async Storage to add, update read and filter notes which have a maximum character length of 500 characters.

The application also allows you to add a note as a favourite, search for notes via the note text, furthermore, filter the notes via ascending, descending order of the note text property,
ascending order of the date created or filter by favourites.

In addition, there is a drawer icon on the left hand side that for the time being just has a Home button. My plan is to additional features to this application in the future.
